# plasmid

Two Python scripts to calculate the superatomic and collectivity characters of singlet-singlet vertical transitions ruling the photo-absorption spectrum of  a silver or gold nanocluster. The former takes as argument a sTDA output and molden files. The latter inputs only a sTDA output file.

Usage:

python supat.py -stda fname.stda -molden fname.molden

python collect.py -stda fname.stda
